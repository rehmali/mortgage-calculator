ðŸ§® Just Built a Mortgage Calculator using HTML, CSS & Vanilla JavaScript! ðŸ’»

Excited to share a project I recently completed â€” a fully responsive Mortgage Repayment Calculator built from scratch using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks or libraries).

ðŸ’¡ Features:
Dynamic calculation of monthly repayments
Supports both Repayment and Interest Only mortgage types
Interactive form with validation and visual feedback
Smooth animations for result display
Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
This was a great exercise in deepening my core web development skills, especially focusing on:
âœ… DOM manipulation
âœ… UX interactions
âœ… Clean layout and styling
âœ… State transitions without any external tools

Would love to get your feedback â€” and if you're building similar projects, feel free to connect!
